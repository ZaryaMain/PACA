<h1>Winter Break</h1>
<p>
You got nothing to do besides stare at the window, watching snow fall and cars fall into ditches. Fair enough, you'd wish you had your metal sled and attaching it behind a vehicle so you could catch a ride behind, most snow days are boring as a kid who is always bored and never motivated to do anything, do not forget that you don't have to go anywhere on a snow day, am I correct?
</p>

<h1>Hits and Misses</h1>
<p>
You can enjoy some quality time with your friends or family at once in a cold snowy day, no need to go to school (portions of the country may have normal school day(s) southern America receives any snowfall to call it a day off). Having fun in the snow, slide and start a snowball fight or ride your bike and make a snow ramp to jump, or using a sled to jump. Other fun stuff as well!
</p>
<p>
May not get around snowy weather in your vehicle, depends if yours is tough enough to handle it without any mistakes. Most people could develop common cold symptoms and spread it unexpectedly, make sure you <i>don't</i> catch one! One big thing and sometimes overlooked, always stay warm and never get a frostbite because frostbites are as bad as burns, maybe worse.
